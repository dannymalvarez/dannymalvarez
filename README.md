# A little bit about me
Hi, my name is Daniel! I am a recent software development bootcamp graduate. During my training I was taught the foundations of HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL, Django, and .NET Framework. I have experience in Project Management, Estimating, Construction, Customer Service, and Sales as well as a B.S in Marketing from Clemson University. One of my dreams is to have a manual Dodge Charger. Fun fact: In Peru, they eat Guinea Pig and it tastes a lot like Chicken in my opinion. I can taste the difference between waters #hydrohomie. And I love talking to people! One of the reasons I love talking to people is it's a great opportunity to learn about their interests and perspectives which helps me grow!

I have decided to pursue a career in tech as a naturally curious person wanting to commit to a life of learning. The fact that much of tech is still so young and has so much evolution left is very exciting to me! There was a time I looked forward to graduating college, getting a job, a dog, and a place to live. Then beginning a cycle of going to work, coming home to my dog, and going to sleep. Only to do it all over again for who knows how long. Since then, I have realized that I want to do so much more than just have a job. I want to learn. And quite frankly, the jobs I have held have only had so much to offer. Now, I remember a time without the internet and smartphones. I have seen how far technology has come and I am incredibly excited to see how far it goes! And I'm even more excited to be a part of that! With that in mind, I am looking for a place that will not just have me but that has a culture of learning and mentorship. I believe, once fully equipped, that I'm going to build something awesome. The question is, with who will that be?

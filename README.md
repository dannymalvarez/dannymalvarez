- Hi, I'm Daniel Alvarez (@dannymalvarez)!
- I'm interested in one of the weirdest assortments you could imagine. If I had to list a few: DIY, working on cars and small engines, maintaining my home and property, animals/pets, Call of Duty, Minecraft, action movies, TMNT, anime, tech, religion, ethics, fitness, music, nature, football, basketball, MMA, health, maroon/crimson colors, college football, coding, problem-solving, engineering, and I spend a lot of time pondering perpetual energy despite knowing it's a dead-end yet fun to wonder. And that's just from thinking for a little bit. lol.
- I'm currently learning to code in order to transition into a career in software development. Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, and whichever language any potential employer may ask me to learn!
- I'm looking to collaborate on anything that will further my understanding, allow me to sharpen my skills, challenge me to learn and grow, and provide a fulfilling end goal. I have a particular interest in modular tech (specifically phones) and have been pointed in the direction of Purism which I intend to look at once I have more coding under my belt.

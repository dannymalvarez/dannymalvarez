# A little bit about me
Hi! Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! I am a Hispanic-American born to immigrant parents from Honduras and Peru. I pride myself in intentionally seeking out growth and understanding in my personal and professional life. Through that intentionality, I have learned a lot about myself and have had to confront habits, beliefs, and comforts that I once held close. My transition to a new career is one of the latest steps in my growth. As I transition to the tech industry, I am seeking out a workplace that will not only support my pursuit for growth and understanding but that will allow me to join them in their own pursuit of improvement. I think much can be achieved when we are willing to recognize the impact of what we do, as well as the ways our processes (and mindsets!) can be improved. If you would like to get in touch with me, I check my email and LinkedIn messages regularly and would love to connect!

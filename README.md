# A little bit about me
I am a Hispanic-American born to immigrant parents from Honduras and Peru. That experience along with how school and various other environments have shaped me over the years, have taught me a few key things about myself. First of all, I take pride in intentionally seeking out growth and understanding in my personal and professional life. Part of my growth is transitioning to a career in tech, as I have not quite found my place in construction, sales, or retail. I am seeking out a workplace that will not only support my pursuit for growth and understanding but that will allow me to join them in their own pursuit of improvement. I think much can be achieved when we are willing to recognize the impact of what we do, as well as the ways our processes (and mindsets!) can be improved.

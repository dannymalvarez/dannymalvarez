- 👋 Hi, I’m @dannymalvarez
- 👀 I’m interested in one of the weirdest assortments you could imagine. If I had to list a few: diy, working on cars and small engines, maintaining my home and property, animals/pets, Call od Duty, Minecraft, action movies, TMNT, anime, tech, religion, ethics, fitness, music, nature, football, basketball, mma, health, maroon/crimson, college football, coding, problem-solving, engineering, alcohol.. and that's just from thinking for a little bit. lol.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in order to transition into a career in software development. Javasript, HTML, CSS, and whichever language any potential employer may ask me to learn!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will further my understanding, allow me to sharpen my skills, challenge me to learn and grow, and that will have a good end goal in mind.
- 📫 How to reach me: Hmm
